		<h1>My Story</h1>
		<p>During the winter break, my partner mainly worked and tried to relax throughout the break. He said he was pretty busy at work because his coworker had gone on a three week vacation so it left him to do most of the work on his own. Toward the end of the break, his nephew was born and was named Nathan. His favorite part of the winter break was being able to stay home and getting to spend time with his family. </p>
