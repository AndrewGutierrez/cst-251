				Mission
			</h2>
			<div class="content">
				The mission of Learning for Life Charter School is to enable students in grades 7 through 12 who have dropped out of or are at risk of dropping out of traditional schools to become motivated again to learn, to develop a desire to complete their high school education and earn a high school diploma. Through an individualized study program each student will be encouraged to become a self-motivated, competent, life-long teacher.
